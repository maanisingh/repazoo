```
**ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**

Perform comprehensive analysis covering:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Overall sentiment score (-1.0 to 1.0)
   - Positive/negative/neutral ratio
   - Concerning patterns
   - Representative quotes

2. **Theme Extraction**:
   - Top 5-7 themes
   - Frequency and relevance
   - Sentiment per theme
   - Controversial topics

[... additional categories ...]
```

**Purpose**: Explicit, detailed instructions for each analysis component

**Design Choices:**

### 5. Output Schema

```
**REQUIRED JSON OUTPUT SCHEMA:**
```json
{
  "sentiment": {
    "overall_sentiment": "positive|neutral|negative|mixed",
    "sentiment_score": -1.0 to 1.0,
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

Return ONLY the JSON object with no additional text.
```

**Purpose**: Ensures consistent, parseable output

**Schema Design:**
- Explicit type constraints
- Range specifications
- Enum options for categorical fields
- Required vs. optional fields clearly marked

## Prompt Optimization Techniques

### 1. Token Efficiency

**Strategy**: Maximize information density while minimizing tokens

**Techniques:**
- Abbreviate repetitive patterns
- Use structured formats (tables, lists)
- Truncate long tweets
- Limit example count
- Remove unnecessary whitespace

**Example:**
```
Before (verbose):
Please analyze the sentiment of each tweet and provide an overall sentiment
score ranging from negative one point zero to positive one point zero, where
negative values indicate negative sentiment and positive values indicate
positive sentiment.

After (efficient):
Analyze sentiment:
- Overall score: -1.0 (negative) to 1.0 (positive)
- Per-tweet classification: positive/neutral/negative
```

### 2. Clarity Enhancement

**Strategy**: Reduce ambiguity to improve accuracy

**Techniques:**
- Use specific numbers (e.g., "5-7 themes" not "several themes")
- Define ranges explicitly (e.g., "0.0 to 1.0")
- Provide examples for complex requirements
- Use consistent terminology throughout

**Example:**
```
Unclear:
"Assess the risk level"

Clear:
"Calculate risk score (0-100):
- 0-30: Low
- 30-60: Medium
- 60-85: High
- 85-100: Critical"
```

### 3. Output Consistency

**Strategy**: Guarantee parseable, structured responses

**Techniques:**
- Explicitly require JSON format
- Provide complete schema example
- Specify "no additional text" constraint
- Use retry prompts for malformed responses

**Retry Prompt:**
```
The previous response could not be parsed as valid JSON.

ERROR: {error_message}

Please provide valid JSON following the exact schema. Ensure:
1. All fields present and correctly named
2. No trailing commas
3. All strings properly quoted
4. Balanced brackets and braces
```

### 4. Context Preservation

**Strategy**: Maintain relevant context while controlling prompt length

**Techniques:**
- Prioritize recent tweets
- Include high-engagement content
- Sample diverse content types
- Preserve temporal ordering
- Summarize older content

**Example:**
```
**RECENT TWEETS** (Last 30 days):
[Detailed individual tweets]

**OLDER CONTENT SUMMARY** (30-90 days ago):
- Total tweets: 50
- Primary themes: Technology (45%), Personal (30%), Politics (25%)
- Average sentiment: Positive (0.6)
```

### 5. Cultural Sensitivity

**Strategy**: Account for cultural context and regional differences

**Techniques:**
- Note user's apparent location/culture
- Request cultural context consideration
- Distinguish regional language differences
- Flag content requiring cultural expertise

**Example:**
```
**CULTURAL CONTEXT:**
- Consider regional language variations
- Account for cultural norms and customs
- Distinguish between offensive vs. acceptable language in user's context
- Flag culturally ambiguous content for review
```

âœ“ Request JSON-only output
âœ“ Include retry logic
âœ“ Consider cultural context
âœ“ Optimize token usage
âœ“ Test extensively

### Don'ts

âœ— Neglect edge cases
âœ— Skip validation steps
âœ— Forget error handling

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

For complex risk assessments:

```
Analyze this content step-by-step:

1. First, identify any concerning keywords or phrases
2. Then, assess the context in which they appear
3. Next, evaluate the user's intent
4. Consider alternative interpretations
5. Assess the severity based on purpose ({purpose})
6. Determine confidence level
7. Provide final assessment with justification
```

### Few-Shot Learning

Include examples for complex tasks:

```
**EXAMPLE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS:**

Input: "Just got promoted! Excited for the new challenges ahead."
Output: {
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "score": 0.85,
  "confidence": 0.9
}

Input: "Another day, another disaster. Nothing ever goes right."
Output: {
  "sentiment": "negative",
  "score": -0.75,
  "confidence": 0.85
}

Now analyze the user's tweets using this approach.
```

### Self-Consistency

Request internal validation:

```
After completing your analysis:

1. Review each finding for evidence support
2. Check for internal contradictions
3. Verify all scores are in valid ranges
4. Confirm confidence levels are appropriate
5. Validate JSON format correctness

Then provide your final analysis.
```
