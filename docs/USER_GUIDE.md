#### 6. Personalized Recommendations

**Example Recommendations:**

**CRITICAL Priority - Address Within 24 Hours**

**Recommendation #1: Review Politically-Charged Tweets**

**Category:** Content Strategy
**Effort Level:** Medium (2-3 hours)

**Description:**
Review and consider removing or editing 3 tweets that express strong political opinions. These tweets may limit your job search opportunities with certain employers.

**Rationale:**
For your stated purpose (job search), political neutrality is valuable. 30-40% of employers may have concerns about partisan content. Your professional expertise is strong - don't let unrelated opinions overshadow it.

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduces risk score from 23 to 12 (LOW to VERY LOW)
- Expands potential employer pool by 30-40%
- Presents you as focused on professional contributions, not politics

**Action Steps:**
1. Navigate to Twitter and locate the 3 flagged tweets (URLs provided)
2. For each tweet, decide: delete, make private, or add clarifying context
3. Consider: "If a hiring manager read only this tweet, what would they think?"
4. Alternative: Keep tweets but update bio to emphasize professional focus

---

**HIGH Priority - Address This Week**

**Recommendation #2: Increase Professional Content Frequency**

**Category:** Brand Building
**Effort Level:** Low (ongoing)

**Description:**
Post 2-3 more tweets per week about your technical expertise, work projects, or industry insights. This will strengthen your professional brand and dilute less relevant content.

**Rationale:**
Your tech content performs best (8.2% engagement) and supports your job search goal. More professional content increases the ratio of career-relevant posts.

**Expected Impact:**
- Stronger thought leadership positioning
- Higher relevance scores for professional themes
- Better first impression for profile visitors

**Action Steps:**
1. Set a calendar reminder for Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10 AM (your peak engagement times)
2. Tweet about: projects you're working on, tutorials, industry observations, or career lessons
3. Use 1-2 relevant hashtags for discoverability
4. Engage with responses to build community

---

**MEDIUM Priority - Plan for Next Month**

**Recommendation #3: Archive Old Content**

**Category:** Risk Mitigation
**Effort Level:** Low (1 hour)

**Description:**
Consider archiving or deleting tweets older than 2 years that don't align with your current professional brand.

**Rationale:**
Your interests and communication style have evolved. Old tweets may not represent who you are today professionally.

**Expected Impact:**
- Removes outdated content that might be misinterpreted
- Ensures profile visitors see your current, polished presence
- Reduces noise in your message

**Action Steps:**
1. Use Twitter's advanced search to filter tweets by date
2. Review tweets from 2022 and earlier
3. Delete anything that makes you cringe or doesn't serve your current goals
4. Keep meaningful milestones or achievements

**Screenshot Description:** Recommendations list with color-coded priority indicators, expandable cards showing full details for each recommendation.

### Confidence Scores

- **0.90-1.0 (Very High):** AI is extremely confident in this assessment
- **0.75-0.89 (High):** Strong confidence, likely accurate
- **0.60-0.74 (Medium):** Moderate confidence, generally reliable
- **Below 0.60 (Low):** Lower confidence, consider human review

**Human Review Flag:**
If Repazoo detects HIGH or CRITICAL risks with LOW confidence, you'll see:
> "Human review recommended for this analysis"

This means the AI found something concerning but isn't fully certain. Consider getting a second opinion from a trusted advisor.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "Failed to Connect Twitter Account"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Twitter might be down or experiencing issues
2. Browser blocked the popup window
3. You clicked "Deny" instead of "Authorize" on Twitter

**Solutions:**
1. Check Twitter.com - is it accessible?
2. Allow popups from repazoo.com in your browser settings
3. Try again and click "Authorize app" on Twitter
4. Clear your browser cache and cookies
5. Try a different browser
6. Disable browser extensions (especially ad blockers)

#### Issue: "Analysis Failed" or "Processing Error"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Your Twitter account has very few tweets
2. Temporary server issue
3. Twitter API rate limit reached

**Solutions:**
1. Check Requirements: You need at least 10 tweets for analysis
2. Wait 5 minutes and try again
3. Contact support with the error code displayed
4. Check your internet connection

#### Issue: "Quota Exceeded"

**What It Means:**
You've used all your monthly analysis requests.

**Solutions:**
1. Wait until your billing date for quota reset
2. Upgrade to Pro tier for 10x more quota
3. Review past analyses instead of running new ones

#### Issue: "Payment Failed"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Insufficient funds
2. Card expired
3. Bank declined the charge
4. Incorrect card details

**Solutions:**
1. Update payment method: Settings > Billing > Update Card
2. Contact your bank to authorize the charge
3. Try a different payment method
4. You have a 3-day grace period to fix payment issues

#### Issue: "Can't See My Recent Tweets"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Your tweets are protected/private on Twitter
2. You deleted tweets after Repazoo fetched them
3. Twitter API caching (can take a few minutes for new tweets to appear)

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure your Twitter account is public (required for analysis)
2. Wait 15 minutes and try analysis again
3. Recent tweets posted within the last hour might not be included yet

#### Issue: Analysis Shows "Human Review Required"

**What It Means:**
The AI detected potentially serious risks but has low confidence in the assessment. A human should verify.

**What to Do:**
1. Carefully review the flagged content yourself
2. Show the report to a trusted friend or advisor
3. Contact Repazoo support for a manual review (Pro tier)
